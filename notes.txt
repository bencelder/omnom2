For each project, set up a virtual environment:

virtualenv venv

In the main folder, we'll start the python environment

. venv/bin/activate

Later deactivate with

deactivate

Export the name of the app with

export FLASK_APP=hello.py

If you want debugging/automatic reloading of code, also do

export FLASK_DEBUG=1

But NEVER do this on a production server!  It is open to external attacks.

Finally, run the server with

flask run
